# Section 5: Networking

## üß≠ Overview

Networking is the backbone of all communication in cybersecurity. This module introduces core networking concepts, protocols, and tools that are essential for understanding how systems communicate, how data flows, and how attackers can exploit networks. You‚Äôll explore IP addressing, common protocols, ports, OSI layers, and basic packet analysis.

## üìå Key Concepts

| Topic             | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IP Addressing     | Learn IPv4 and subnetting, including private vs. public IPs                 |
| Ports & Protocols | Understand TCP/UDP ports and protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, DNS           |
| OSI Model         | Explore the 7-layer network model and how data moves through each layer     |
| Packet Analysis   | Analyze raw network data using Wireshark or tcpdump                         |
| Common Attacks    | Learn about ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning, and port scanning                  |
| Network Scanning  | Use tools like `nmap` to discover hosts, services, and open ports           |

## üß™ Hands‚ÄëOn Practice Examples

### üîç IP Configuration & Routing

```bash
ip a                     # View IP addresses
ip route show            # Display routing table
ping 8.8.8.8             # Check connectivity
traceroute google.com    # View route taken by packets
```
